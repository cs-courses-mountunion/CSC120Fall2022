							In hero.java, the following statement needed to be inserted before lines 21 and 22:
<pre>
    loc = new Random();
</pre>
                            Then in MUPanel.java, the following code was needed starting at line 36:
<pre>
        clown = new obstacle[10];
        for (int c = 0; c &lt; clown.length; c++) {
            clown[c] = new obstacle(c*55 + 30, c*20+30);
        }
</pre>
                            When those changes were made, program output looks like this:<br/>
